# Memory Game
A game similar to concentration, the purpose is to match the same cards until all cards are matched.

## How to Run  
To get started:
* Download files from GitHub at https://github.com/cglisson/Memory-Game.

## How to Play

* Upon opening the index.html page, a board will open.
* Click on a card to reveal a symbol, then reveal another by clicking on a different card.
    * If they match, the cards will lock in place.
    * If not, then they will flip back to their normal state.
